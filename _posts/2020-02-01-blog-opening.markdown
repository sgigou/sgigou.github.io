Hi! My name is Steve Gigou and I am very glad you are reading this.


# Who am I?
I am a French independent computer engineer, currently working on [my own iOS apps](https://steve.gigou.fr). This is my first professional blog, but I have some experience in personal blogging.

I used to work for French companies as a developer and a Scrum Master. After some time, I decided it was time to try my luck as an independent worker.

I mostly experienced Objective-C, Swift, PHP and C++. And I finally chose Swift!


# Why start a blog?

I decided to launch this website because I wanted to share my experience in development. As an independent developer, I run into problems daily, and I think their resolution may be interesting for other people.

Il will not only share tips for Swift development, but also for anything related to apps production: methodology, website creation, UX, prototyping, accounting, time management, productivityâ€¦

I hope that any computer scientist will find articles that are relevant to him or her.


# Can we talk?
